<h3>Part 1</h3>

<h4>Location: Yalta, 6A Mukhin St. #52. Everything is recorded on a camcorder. This is an almost exact transcription, a phonogram. Occasionally, I have added necessary explanations&mdash;<span class="author-note">they are in square brackets</span>. <span class="translator-note">Translation-specific annotations and definitions are also in square brackets</span>.  Some things must be explained separately, for example, that Chkalov and Orenburg are really the same town and region, named and renamed back in &rsquo;38 and &rsquo;57, respectively.  Obvious repetitions have been omitted. Sometimes, Katya Schmoll, to whom this is all being told, asks questions. This is the reason for some of the explanations, which, to a Russian ear, may seem unnecessary.</h4>

<dt>Ben</dt>
<dd><p><span class="author-note">[The whole town was covered in posters for]</span> the play <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em>, starring Ben Wolfson in the leading role. I was playing Tom Sawyer. It was a big event for the town.</p></dd>
<dt>Katya</dt><dd> <p>How many people lived in Gomel&rsquo; then?</p></dd>
<dt>Ben</dt><dd><p>I think there were around 150,000 residents. It was a large industrial town, with milling, metalwork and train car construction. It was a rail hub&mdash;trains left in four directions&hellip;</p>
<p>And so, in &rsquo;41, I was just about to reap the laurels of success&hellip; On opening night, the director&mdash;Mark L&rsquo;vovich Rechels&mdash;came, and gave me a kiss, and said, &ldquo;I congratulate you on this outstanding success, your first premiere, and I think that I will be able to recommend you for the Moscow Institute of Theatrical Arts (<abbr title="Gossudarstvinnyj Institut Tiatral'nogo ISkustva">GITIS</abbr>). It is a very good institute where you will get a real theatrical education&rdquo; I was at a loss for words. This was my first leading role. Until then, my only role had been a small part as an old robber in the Evgeny Schwartz play <em>The Snow Queen</em>. The director noticed me, and said, &ldquo;this will be a perfect Tom Sawyer.&rdquo; &hellip;</p></dd>
<dt>Katya</dt>
<dd><p>And how old were you?</p></dd>
<dt>Ben</dt>
<dd><p>I had finished ninth grade, but I was very short, kind of nimble&hellip; Just like now, I had gray eyes&hellip; Well, back then I was blond&mdash;it&rsquo;s only now that I&rsquo;m bald&hellip; I wasn&rsquo;t even a blond. I would say I was an albino <span class="author-note">[a mistake]</span> with white, straw-colored hair. Well, anyway, he saw something he liked in me, and made me Tom Sawyer&hellip;</p>
<p>I walked down the streets thinking that everyone was looking only at me. How could it be otherwise&mdash;I&rsquo;d become a celebrity!&hellip; And on Sunday, <span class="author-note">[the morning after opening night]</span> when everyone was playing in the yard, I stood back and didn&rsquo;t play much with the guys&hellip; because I was &ldquo;famous&rdquo;&hellip; and then at that moment, from an open window, we heard <span class="author-note">[on the radio]</span> the news that the war had begun. That the Germans had crossed the border. That they were bombing Kiev, Minsk, Sevastopol&rsquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t understand what war was yet; the older generation knew that war is a horrible event, but we boys&hellip;</p></dd>
<dt>Katya</dt><dd><p>Had you already heard Stalin&rsquo;s speech?</p></dd>
<dt>Ben</dt>
<dd><p>The speech hadn&rsquo;t happened yet. Stalin&rsquo;s speech came two weeks later <span class="author-note">[after the start of the war]</span>. At this point, only Molotov had spoken. We hadn&rsquo;t heard Stalin&rsquo;s speech yet&hellip; But I understood that it was serious. And quickly ran to the Pioneers Palace <span class="translator-note">[the Young Pioneers was a youth organization that planned activities and taught Communist ideology]</span> to sign up for the &ldquo;Young Voroshilov Rifleman&rdquo; club. On day one we got ammunition and small-gauge rifles&hellip;</p></dd>
<dt>Katya</dt><dd><p>On day one?</p></dd>
<dt>Ben</dt>
<dd><p>Well, yeah. We were just learning how to shoot. In the evening, I came home and said that &ldquo;now I&rsquo;m not afraid of the fascists&mdash;I know how to shoot.&rdquo; Because on day one, they didn&rsquo;t teach us how to take apart and assemble a rifle, but instead, right away&mdash;how to shoot&hellip;</p>
<p>Alright&hellip;</p>
<p>So a week of these half-games, half-serious preparations for evacuation went by&hellip; Because my father, who&rsquo;d been a soldier during the last war&mdash;fought in West Prussia&mdash;had served as an artilleryman&hellip; got gassed&hellip; then he was in a hospital&hellip; transported to Gomel&rsquo;&mdash;or near Gomel&rsquo;&mdash;where he met my mom and they married&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, anyway, Dad came home after work and said, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the thing, comrades, my children, dear friends&mdash;let&rsquo;s all start sewing some knapsacks. Because we&rsquo;re probably going to have to evacuate&hellip;&rdquo; But on the radio, in the newspapers, they&rsquo;re saying that the war&rsquo;ll be over in two weeks, that we&rsquo;ll take that Kraut and tear him limb from limb; that just the other day, a plane was seen leaving a white trail of smoke, which means that the Germans have synthetic <span class="author-note">[probably artificial]</span> fuel, so their gasoline is running out, and the war will be over tomorrow if not today&hellip; But just in case, if the Kraut gets here, we should take the brass knobs off the door&mdash;so that he doesn&rsquo;t get the brass, because Hitler&rsquo;s hard-pressed for non-ferrous metals and doesn&rsquo;t have any of it <span class="author-note">[brass]</span>&hellip;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, let&rsquo;s prepare our knapsacks. They&mdash;mom&mdash;sewed knapsacks for us, for me, and my sister (my brother was in Leningrad at the time). We packed them with a change of clothes, a bag of some kind of biscuits, a package of sugar, matches, salt&mdash; the kinds of things that my mom and dad knew were the most scarce during war. Well, they sat there ready for us, these knapsacks. I knew an evacuation was possible&mdash;Dad said so&mdash;for a time, maybe two weeks, while we destroyed Hitler, and then we&rsquo;d come back home&hellip; Our valiant Red Army will destroy Hitler, and we&rsquo;ll come home&hellip; And so we assembled these things and put them by the door to the apartment&mdash;at any moment, you could grab them and leave.</p>
<p>So, one day, my dad came home&mdash;it was the fifth or sixth day <span class="author-note">[of the war?]</span>, and said that the machine-tool factory was being evacuated from Gomel&rsquo;, and that we would probably be evacuated with it. Stalin came on the radio two weeks later. The matter was more serious. Hitler was coming up on Babruysk, was almost in Gomel&rsquo;. The battles were very violent.</p></dd> 
<dt>Katya</dt><dd><p>This was all during the summer?</p></dd>
<dt>Ben</dt>
<dd><p>Yes, this was all during the summer; July. So, we tied up all our bedding into a big knot: the pillows, the blankets, everything soft we could take. Of course we couldn&rsquo;t even think about bringing anything else. We came to the train on some kind of cart, loaded our things, and set off during the night. We were evacuated to somewhere near Khar&rsquo;kov. There&rsquo;s a station&mdash;Balakleya, where there was a munitions factory that was working at full tilt producing shells for the front. Not far from Balakleya, past the Izym station, we were brought to a <em class="foreign">kolkhoz</em>, <span class="translator-note">[a kind of communal farm]</span> and we started to work there.</p>
<p>Well, it wasn&rsquo;t really the kind of &ldquo;work&rdquo; you&rsquo;d expect&hellip; We were told, &ldquo;you are farm hands, but for the present time, you&rsquo;ll be building an airfield. From which our very own, Stalin&rsquo;s hawks, will rise into the sky and break the fascist invaders.&rdquo; So we built the airfield, and the planes hadn&rsquo;t even arrived&mdash;they were usually these biplanes, they&rsquo;d later be called corn-dusters during the war because they flew very low over the corn and dropped bombs. The anti-aircraft guns couldn&rsquo;t reach them&hellip; And then at night they told us, &ldquo;quickly get your things together, we have to evacuate further, the Germans are coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We rode to the station on carts from the <em class="foreign">kolkhoz</em> and got on that munitions factory&rsquo;s flatcars; they were already holding machine benches from the factory&hellip; There were no roofs and no tarps. Under the open sky, with long stops, we were transported in those flatcars toward the Volga. We were going toward the Volga. Rain, wind, bad weather&hellip; fall was already arriving. At the end of August, the frost started to come in at night. I was remembering how in Gomel&rsquo;, when it was time to start school on September 1, my mom would give us each a small &ldquo;French&rdquo;-style roll and an Antonovka apple, so that we could have them during lunch. We walked on sidewalks already covered in ice&mdash;on September 1&hellip; And here we were heading east, north-east&mdash;it was already getting cold.</p>
<p>And so we arrived at Buguruslan station, where they had the &ldquo;table,&rdquo; the evacuees&rsquo; bureau, where one of the fellows in charge said, &ldquo;who wants to go where? Come on, tell us, we&rsquo;re sending you right away.&rdquo; My father, who was 53 back then, he was poisoned with gas during the first world war; he had a stomach ulcer, he wouldn&rsquo;t be drafted&hellip; and he came from the country, from country blacksmiths, his whole family was blacksmiths&hellip; he understood that war meant hunger. Even without the war we had a real famine in &rsquo;30&hellip; I remember it well&hellip;</p>
<p>He went up to the table, to that administrator, and said, &ldquo;Dear comrade, we&rsquo;ll go to the farthest possible <em class="foreign">kolkhoz</em>.&rdquo; Everyone was surprised. We were from the city. All the city folk were asking to go to cities. And here we were asking to go to the country&hellip; And it turned out that we made the right decision. We worked through September, caught a bit of October, and got a ton and a half of wheat. They gave us wonderful Ural wheat in exchange for our work-day units&mdash;as much as we&rsquo;d earned. And that saved us.</p>
<p>The horses were sent to the front.</p></dd> 
<dt>Katya</dt><dd><p>And where was this <em class="foreign">kolkhoz</em>?</p></dd>
<dt>Ben</dt><dd><p>In the Urals. Near the town of Chkalov. It was 110 km away from the Chkalov area, 30 km away from the regional seat, and 100 km to the nearest railroad. To Chkalov, it was maybe 150 km.</p></dd>
<dt>Katya</dt><dd><p>And where did you live there?</p></dd>
<dt>Ben</dt>
<dd><p>The inhabitants all took us into their homes. They were Ural Cossacks. They didn&rsquo;t call us &ldquo;evacuated,&rdquo; they called us &ldquo;plucked out.&rdquo; Well, never mind that. The people turned out to be very kind. It was mostly women, because the men were already at war. Young, healthy guys were at war, and my time was coming. Because I had finished ninth grade, and those who finished tenth grade were already conscripted. If we had lived in a city and worked at a factory, then maybe we wouldn&rsquo;t have been called to fight. And in the spring, we were sent to the enlistment office.</p>
<p><span class="author-note">[They]</span> sent me to the military academy. Since I was from the country, and so were my buddies, we were sent to cavalry training. They gave us these fierce Mongolian horses that bit; the horses ran wild over there in the steppes, and they roped them in&hellip; They were small and wild and mean&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, we fooled around with the horses for a bit&mdash;it was already November&mdash;and suddenly they took the horses away and said, &ldquo;Start training on machine guns immediately! You will be artillery lieutenants, not cavalry lieutenants.&rdquo; We trained on machine guns for a month. We took an oath of allegiance. My mom and dad came to visit me. They brought me a whole bag of biscuits. During the war this was a real treasure. They rented an apartment near the military academy, which was enclosed by a fence, and there was a hole in the fence. We knew about the hole, and through this hole, I&rsquo;d come to this woman&rsquo;s house, where my mom and dad would leave a bag of biscuits, fill my pockets, and come back to the academy. And I&rsquo;d share with the guys who were next to me&mdash;in my platoon, in my division, my friends. Soon the biscuits ran out. And in November, toward the end of November, they said, &ldquo;Fall in! Head out! In formation: Step!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so we went straight to the train station. They put us in the cars and sent us near Moscow, to the Tula region&mdash;Leo Tolstoy station. I really distinguished myself there&hellip; I was put on guard duty, watching over an ammunition stockpile. I didn&rsquo;t know that the stockpile had ammunition and lit a cigarette&mdash;it was the first time I&rsquo;d rolled one myself. It was cold standing there, and I zoned out.</p>
<p>And suddenly I hear the crunch of footsteps in the snow. Someone was coming up to me. I opened my eyes&mdash;the man was standing two meters from me. I shouted as loud as I could, &ldquo;Halt! Who goes there?!&rdquo; He was so startled he almost fell over himself. Turned out to be the lieutenant, who was checking up on the guard posts, making sure the watchmen were there. So I was commended for guarding the ammunitions very well and as someone who distinguished himself. Back then I had the rank of &ldquo;Junior Corporal&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Junior Sergeant&rdquo;&mdash;that was my junior rank. They transferred me to a very good platoon that was getting ready to be sent to the front. I don&rsquo;t even know how it was organized. I was a &ldquo;Regular Sergeant.&rdquo; What does that mean? They didn&rsquo;t tell us&hellip; but one night they put us in train cars and sent us&mdash;an entire echelon&mdash;toward Stalingrad.</p>
<br /> 
<p>I want to tell just one more episode, about when we were celebrating New Year&rsquo;s <span class="author-note">[in the Urals]</span>&mdash;it was the village of Rzhavka, in the Novosergeev section of the Chkalovsk region. For some reason, a salesgirl took a liking to me. She said, &ldquo;tonight we&rsquo;re getting a package, come help us unload it from the cart.&rdquo; I came, and I helped, because there were no men&mdash;we were the oldest men. I helped her unload the cart, and she gave me a piece of sugar for it. I came home with that piece of sugar and my dad said, &ldquo;Today is New Year&rsquo;s Eve, December 31, 1941. Tomorrow is January 1.&rdquo; To celebrate, we made some tea, and sat with auntie Vasyuna&mdash;Vasiliya Pavlovna Bykov, a Ural Cossack in whose house we were living. I remembered that last name, it came in very handy later. And so we drank our tea and we went to bed. We set the alarm clock to wake us up at midnight, but it didn&rsquo;t ring. We woke up in the morning. But I remembered, we lit two or three lamps for the New Year&rsquo;s celebration and when I came home from unloading that cart, I noticed that auntie Vasyuna had already taken down the documents she&rsquo;d gotten at the All-Union Exhibition and hung up icons; That is, in the Urals, the Cossacks felt that maybe they&rsquo;d have to worship something more than portraits of Lenin; the icons were the only things they could believe in.</p></dd>

<dt>Ben</dt>
<dd><p>They took us to Leo Tolstoy station, loaded us in train cars, and we left for Stalingrad. &rsquo;42 was ending. It was a terrifying time, because the Germans were in Stalingrad, and the question &ldquo;to be or not to be&rdquo; was being decided.</p></dd>
<dt>Katya</dt><dd><p>When did they get to Stalingrad?</p></dd>
<dt>Ben</dt>
<dd><p>They got to Stalingrad in the fall, the fall of &rsquo;42. In December &rsquo;41, they were beaten back near Moscow, and then they directed most of their strength toward the Volga&mdash;to cut off the Volga and capture the oil.</p>
<p>We arrived at Borisoglebsk in the Voronezh region and unloaded. While we were travelling, we became friends. Some of our guys at some station snuck into another car and stole a bag of cubed sugar. And we were travelling in a group of all machine gunners. The heavy machine guns were with us&mdash;we hid the sugar with the ammo. Everyone else was riding in closed cars, but we machine gunners were out on flatcars. It was cold&mdash;November, December&mdash;the frosts had come&hellip; We ate the sugar and warmed up a little. We took boiling water from the steam engine and drank tea with that sugar. Well, besides that, they did give us some kind of food&mdash;there was a kitchen car, but it fed all the soldiers with the typical portions&hellip; A soldier will always want to eat and sleep&mdash;those two things&mdash;to get a good night&rsquo;s sleep and a decent meal. We unloaded at Borisoglebsk and started toward Stalingrad on foot.</p>
<p>And I remember very well how we saw our first battle. We were led out into a field and told, &ldquo;Keep in mind, it&rsquo;s possible that the Germans will counterattack with tanks&rdquo; We didn&rsquo;t know then that Manstein wanted to break through to Paulus with the tank corps. We just knew that they would counterattack with tanks. We were still green, basically cadets&hellip; I remember how at night, they led us into some kind of gully, and when it started to get light, we saw that the tanks were approaching. They were moving boldly, openly, without fear. No one was sitting on them, they were just shooting from the machine guns. They advanced, and meanwhile we hadn&rsquo;t been able to dig in yet. We had shovels, but the ground was frozen, and there wasn&rsquo;t much snow, so the tanks advanced and just crushed us.</p>
<p>The first casualties were the ones who got up and started to run&mdash;the machine gunners on the tanks just mowed them down. I didn&rsquo;t run&mdash;not because I wasn&rsquo;t scared, I was scared too&mdash;but out of fear I huddled to the ground and started thinking, &ldquo;how can I fool them and slip away?&mdash;from these tanks?&rdquo; I see that the other guys, who were also scared but didn&rsquo;t run, started to crawl away from the tank to the side. Because the tanks, we were taught, had very limited visibility&mdash;the guy looks through that slit and can&rsquo;t see anything below or above him.</p>
<p>Well, to make a long story short, the tanks crushed anyone they could, and I saw how my buddies tongues&mdash;when the tanks ran over them&mdash;the tongues would be squeezed out onto their chests, it would get all long. Their eyes would get pressed out of their sockets and lie on their cheek bones. It was an awful sight, and my first battle. After the battle they brought us food and no one could eat. What food?! What dinner?! What porridge?! It took us a long time to live that down, but life is life, and war is war, and we had to move on.</p>
<p>And we stepped into battle again. I still remember the first time I saw our <em class="foreign">katyushas</em> <span class="translator-note">[mobile rocket-launchers]</span> shoot. We were lying under a stack of&mdash;not hay, but some other kind of mowed grass, which they used for heating, because it was the steppes and there was nothing there besides this grass which gets dried out and used as fuel. And we were lying there, and suddenly I hear, &ldquo;shhhhhhh&mdash;shhhhh&mdash;shhhhh&rdquo;, and all around me, tongues of flame rise to the sky, and I think, &ldquo;well, that&rsquo;s it&mdash;that&rsquo;s the end of the world.&rdquo; And we lay there, and all my buddies lowered their heads and were afraid to speak. Everything started to smell like gunpowder and smoke. Then we see, someone&rsquo;s yelling, &ldquo;Son of a&hellip;! Get that tarp on faster!&rdquo; They covered the <em class="foreign">katyushas</em>&mdash;since it was all secret&mdash;surprise was a weapon, we couldn&rsquo;t fire them without the tarps, so that the enemey wouldn&rsquo;t know what we were firing from.</p>
<p>The <em class="foreign">katyushas</em> left, and we set off again. We went all the way to Kotel&rsquo;nikovo station. Sometimes in the first echelon, sometimes in the second, sometimes in the rear. The hardest for us was crossing the cold, snow-covered steppes near Stalingrad, where the frost made huge cracks in the ground. The cold got down to 40 below. It was so cold that we burned our skis to keep warm. We got these skis, but the snow wasn&rsquo;t deep, so we didn&rsquo;t need them. And after we had burned our skis and our gas masks, and stolen the wooden ammo boxes from the artillerymen&mdash;we&rsquo;d throw out the ammo and use the gunpowder and wood for the fires&mdash;that&rsquo;s when we got to the deep snow. But by then we already had nothing.</p>
<p>And so we trampled down paths in the snow to step into battle near Kotel&rsquo;nikovo. It was our biggest battle. And here we saw the huge stacks of wheat burning, and the barns full of grain burning. It was all burning; it smelled of burnt bread&hellip; And we walked and battled further.</p>
<p>Near some other town our numbers had really whittled, and we were regrouped. They told us, &ldquo;Come on, move forward. You&rsquo;ll be shooting at tanks with machine guns. And during the day&mdash;at airplanes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We set up our tripods and waited for dawn. We were on a farmstead, part of the &ldquo;Green Grove&rdquo; national farm. We had already moved into the Rostov region.</p>
<p>Suddenly the commander shouts, &ldquo;Do not step back!! Do not retreat!! Stand your ground! The Germans have gone on a counter-offensive!&rdquo; German tanks with machine gunners were approaching. &ldquo;Take any position you can!! Do not step back!!&rdquo; But he stepped back! And we were left without commanders. The commanders who could retreated. We were just privates and sergeants lying there, and I could see that tanks were approaching. So we quickly set up our guns, and as soon as we set the guns upon the tanks, the first tank shell hit us dead on.</p>
<p>My companions are all injured. A piece of shrapnel hits me here <span class="author-note">[in the forehead]</span>, my whole face is covered in blood. It&rsquo;s cold; blood is pouring out from underneath my helmet lining, and onto my winter uniform, and the guys from my cohort are bandaging my head, but blood is still coming through the bandage, and the German tanks are closing in, and their gunners are already around us, and the tanks are coming by and the gunners are commanding, &ldquo;<em class="foreign">Hände hoch!</em>&rdquo; and we&rsquo;re already standing.</p>
<p>I see my lieutenant standing there with his hands up, we&rsquo;re all standing there with our hands up. I&rsquo;ve just managed to throw out and bury my <em class="foreign">komsomol</em> ticket and soldier ID that make it clear that I&rsquo;m a Wolfson, that I can&rsquo;t get captured, because the first bullet to a prisoner will be for me.</p>
<p>So they tell us, &ldquo;<em class="foreign">Hände hoch!</em>&rdquo; and we&rsquo;re standing with our hands up. Some <em class="foreign">Oberleutnant</em> walks by who speaks very good Russian, maybe a Russian German, and says, &ldquo;Any yids? Three steps forward!&rdquo; Right next to me, in the same row, I see my political commissar <span class="translator-note">[a supervisory political officer responsible for the political education of the military and its loyalty to the government]</span>, Dubinchuk, who kind of nudges me on the elbow, as if to say, &ldquo;come on&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stay put.</p>
<p>He (<abbr title="id est">i.e.</abbr> the German) </span>says, &ldquo; Any communists&hellip; any commissars? Three steps forward!&rdquo; I give him <span class="author-note">[Dubinchuk]</span> a little nudge; he stands still. <em>So</em>, I think, <em>stay put. You and I are bound by the same chain. We&rsquo;ll die together, yid and commissar alike. You stay put and don&rsquo;t nudge me.</em> And they started to lead us, in a line. And he shared his biscuits with me, because there was already nothing to eat.</p>
<p>They brought us to some kind of school, near Novocherkass. And we were left to spend the night. There were maybe 30 &ndash; 40 of us in the locked building. And he <span class="author-note">[Dubinchuk]</span> is wide awake next to me. And I&rsquo;m not sleeping either.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that he&rsquo;s gonna step outside and say, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a <em class="foreign">Jude</em> in there, we have to kill him.&rdquo; And he can&rsquo;t sleep, &rsquo;cause he&rsquo;s thinking I&rsquo;ll just leave to turn him in as a commissar. Neither one of us slept. In the morning, we were loaded onto trucks and brought to Rostov. It seemed not far away, maybe 30 km, Rostov on the Don. They put us all in one square and moved on. And we started to wait for the cars that would take us to the P.O.W. camp. And as we&rsquo;re standing and waiting, some people, residents, start to gather around us. Some start to yell, &ldquo;So, is this how Stalin feeds you?&rdquo; Others are asking, &ldquo;How are our boys? Are they coming for us soon?&rdquo; People are people. Everyone responded differently.</p>
<p>I see how an old man and woman on the corner of the street where we&rsquo;re standing&mdash;on the square&mdash;are carrying water toward a hut near a small plaza. I say to the old German who&rsquo;s guarding us:</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;<em class="foreign">Pan</em>!&rdquo;&mdash;everyone called them that&mdash;&ldquo;<em class="foreign">Pan</em>!&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;I&hellip; want&hellip; <em class="foreign">ein bischen wasser&hellip;</em>&rdquo; I show him: &ldquo;<em class="foreign">trinken&hellip;</em>&rdquo;</li> 
</ul>
<p>Myself, I&rsquo;m afraid to speak, even though I know a few words in German, but I&rsquo;m afraid of my pronunciation&mdash;maybe he&rsquo;ll realize I&rsquo;m a Jew, not a German? I have to keep that hidden. It&rsquo;s true, though, my head was bandaged, and the only hair that was sticking out was a blond clump, and I did not look very Jewish, I didn&rsquo;t have any of those features, but I still knew who I was inside.</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;Alright. <em class="foreign">Gut&hellip; aber los&hellip;</em> Quickly, <em class="foreign">zurück</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>I say, &ldquo;<em class="foreign">Gut, gut, pan</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>I go into that hut&mdash;there are the old man and woman, and they say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Russian P.O.W., how did you get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I say, &ldquo;We were captured yesterday. Can I stay with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;Are you crazy?!&rdquo;&mdash;this is the old man talking&mdash;&ldquo;this house is on the corner. Germans come in here very minute! In half an hour some German will walk in here and kill us and kill you too&hellip; You can&rsquo;t stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I say, &ldquo;Maybe your neighbor could hide me?&hellip; Tell her to come out and say that I&rsquo;m her son. The German who&rsquo;s guarding us is old, and maybe he&rsquo;d let me go&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says alright.</p>
<p>So I left and got back in line. Suddenly I see the old man walking over to his neighbor and the neighbor stepping out. She&rsquo;s got on a white Caucasian shawl of some kind; she&rsquo;s a young woman, but, of course, older than me.&hellip; She comes up to me, winks at me, and I nod back that I&rsquo;m the one&hellip;</p>
<p>She yells, &ldquo;My son!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I yell, &ldquo;Mama!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I started to cry&mdash; because my nerves were already giving in.  After this kind of &ldquo;trial run,&rdquo; you either get shot right away or a pistol to the temple. So I cry&hellip;</p>
<p>She says, &ldquo;My son!&rdquo;and starts to soothe me.</p>
<p>The German was so surprised and he says, &ldquo;<em class="foreign">Das ist sein Sohn?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>She says, &ldquo;<em class="foreign">Jawohl, Pan, das ist mein Sohn.</em>&rdquo; And she tells him in German &ldquo;let him go home&mdash;it&rsquo;s right here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was so touched, this German, and so he goes, &ldquo;Alright, but hurry! Hurry, hurry! Get out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And we quickly ran to her house. When I was running to her house, some 50 meters, maybe 40, I don&rsquo;t know, the cars came, and they started loading our guys into the cars. I saw the face of Fyodor Dubinchuk, who was looking in my direction with great joy in his eyes that I was finally separating from him and that no one would know anymore that he was a commissar. And with that in his glance I could see, &ldquo;You lucky son of a bitch, somehow you made it out&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I get to her house and say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Our boys&rsquo;ll be in Rostov by tomorrow. Can I wait in your barn? I have some biscuits&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>She says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;No, young man&hellip; You can&rsquo;t. My husband is a <em class="foreign">Polizei</em>, and we have to evacuate, or the Russians will kill us. Go away from us.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;So you saved me just to hand me over to the <em class="foreign">Polizei</em>?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>She says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Calm down, young man. I did everything I could do&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Alright then here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do. I will leave you. But when the Russians come, ask someone to send a letter to the Orenburg region. Here&rsquo;s the address. I won&rsquo;t write anything, but you send a letter to that address, to the Ural, to our landlord Vasiliya Pavlovna Bykov&rdquo;&mdash;clearly not to the Wolfsons!&mdash;&ldquo;to say, &ldquo;Kolya was at my house, he&rsquo;s alive and well, only he&rsquo;s been captured.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I only found out that she&mdash;or one of the neighbors&mdash;sent that that letter <em>after</em> the war. Mom and Dad told me that, when they got that letter, they could never figure it out&mdash;if it was Ben, then why was Kolya captured? And if it was Kolya, then who&rsquo;s that? Auntie Vasyuna had no Kolyas <span class="author-note">[among her relatives]</span>. My dad couldn&rsquo;t figure anything out, and my mom would step out into the field and cry, and pray to God, and ask the ravens, the birds that were flying by, if they&rsquo;d seen where the bones of her son were buried. But she always prayed, and believed that her God would save me.</p>
<p>So I left her and went back to the old folks. They gave me a German paper bag with a swastika. I put my greatcoat in there&mdash;I still had it with me at that point&mdash;and my winter hat with a star in it, but kept my mittens. I was left wearing a sweater and my quilted pants. The Germans had taken my good felt boots when I was captured and given me bad ones trimmed with veal hide. I clomped in them like a bear.</p>
<p>And I said,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;How many kilometers is it to the front line?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>The old man answered,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Some 20 km&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;And which direction do I go?&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Go toward Aksay.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>It was about 18 km from Rostov. So I set off&hellip; After I walked some 5 km, found some kind of hut. I walked up to it and said,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Can I stay the night here?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>The German army was moving right at me&mdash;retreating from Rostov.  I wanted to cross the front line, and they were retreating from the front, moving past me. She <span class="author-note">[the woman in the house]</span> says,</p> 
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Go ahead, I&rsquo;m not short on space&hellip; But I have a bunch of German soldiers. You&rsquo;ll sleep somewhere in the attic&mdash; but only if the Elder <span class="author-note">[a local villager installed by the Germans]</span> approves.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I can&rsquo;t turn to the Elder&mdash;I have no documents. I&rsquo;m Kolya Korneyev.</p>
<p>Why &ldquo;Korneyev&rdquo;? Because the old man and woman on the corner were Korneyevs&mdash;I found out their last name. So I became a Korneyev too. And Korneyev was a familiar name to me. In the village where we were evacuated, there were lots of Korneyevs. They were Cossacks.</p>
<p>So I get to Aksay, 18 km later. It&rsquo;s already evening, 5 or 6. It&rsquo;s getting dark already. I read a sign that says, &ldquo;Anyone held without their documents will be shot as a partisan. Moving about after 6 p.m. is prohibited.&rdquo; I have no documents and nowhere to sleep. Near every house, there are German tanks, cars, motorcycles, or soldiers: they&rsquo;re retreating. But at night they&rsquo;re not going anywhere, they&rsquo;re staying put.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Katya</dt>
<dd><p>How could you have no documents? Didn&rsquo;t you have something?</p></dd>
<dt>Ben</dt>
<dd><p>What documents would I have? Ones that said that I was a Wolfson?</p></dd>
<dt>Katya</dt>
<dd><p>In war, anything&rsquo;s possible&hellip;</p></dd>
<dt>Ben</dt>
<dd><p>Anything is possible&hellip; But I didn&rsquo;t have any documents. So I get detained. I walked down some alley, thinking that I&rsquo;ll go into an outhouse and spend the night there. It&rsquo;s cold already. It was, I think February 2, 1943.</p>
<p>Suddenly someone puts a gun to my chest:</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Halt! Give the password!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the password.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the <em class="foreign">karnach</em>&hellip;the patrol leader.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>It was either two Uzbeks or Tajiks, or Georgians&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know who they were, but they were from the &ldquo;<em class="foreign">Tyurkish</em>&rdquo; detachment <span class="author-note">[this was written on their uniforms]</span>. They brought me to the patrol leader.</p>
<p>It was a typical country hut, where a German was sitting with some lieutenant, who did the talking.</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;An evacuee. I was running from Stalingrad. All my family was killed there. I&rsquo;m going to my Aunt in Rostov, here. Because she&rsquo;s my only aunt. Maybe she lives in Aksay, so I came here to find out if she lives here.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your last name?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Korneyev.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>He asks the woman in the hut,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
   <li>&ldquo;Do any Korneyevs live around here?&rdquo;</li>
   <li>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t have any here, at least not in the vicinity. Maybe someone does live in Aksay&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>He says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
   <li>&ldquo;Search him!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>The soldier searched me, but didn&rsquo;t find anything. Then the lieutenant came up to me, opened two buttons on my sweater and saw that underneath I was wearing two sets of warm army underclothes. And a soldier&rsquo;s blouse.</p>
<p>He says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
   <li>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that on your forehead?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;I was earning some money for food, chopping wood, and hit it with the axe&hellip;&rdquo; And I immediately realized, why did I say &ldquo;axe?&rdquo; How could I do that with the axe? Maybe a wood chip? He knocked me on the chin <em>hard</em>. And I was still wounded&hellip; the room spun in front of me&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>He says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Confess! Who are you?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip;a P.O.W.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say that?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I tell him,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;I was afraid, comrade translator.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>He hit me again.</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not your comrade! Don&rsquo;t ever call me &lsquo;comrade&rsquo; again!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>He hit me a second time, and I fell.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes when the woman put a boiled beet and carrot into my hand and said,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Here you go. They&rsquo;re gonna take you to the police now, maybe you can eat something because you&rsquo;re probably hungry.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I took the warm beet and carrot and put them in my pocket.  <span class="author-note">[To Katya]</span>A carrot is that thing that bunnies love&hellip; And they led me to the police, at machine gun-point. Two gunmen, these Uzbeks, from &ldquo;Tyurkish.&rdquo; They take me there and I can read the signs on the doors: &ldquo;Gestapo Magistrate,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chief of Police&rdquo;, and then &ldquo;Military Police.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s where they were&hellip;</p>
<p>All the authorities were there.</p>
<p>They take me to the head of the police or his acting replacement, and ask me, &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a P.O.W.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Down below!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>So they brought me down to the basement. In the basement, there&rsquo;s a guy sitting behind a gate in a uniform I can&rsquo;t recognize&mdash;it&rsquo;s not German. He says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a prisoner&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;<em>A-a-a</em>&hellip; A prisoner&hellip; You&rsquo;ll go in this cell. Last name?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Korneyev.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Name and patronymic?&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Nikolay Ivanovich.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Year of birth?&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;&rsquo;24.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Where you from?&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from Chkalov, near Orenburg.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;re a Cossack? Or are you one of the Boors?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
<li>&ldquo;Yeah,&hellip;I&rsquo;m a Cossack.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Korneyev&hellip;&rdquo; he said and looked lost in thought. &ldquo;Korneyev is a Cossack name, not a Boorish one&hellip; Come join our company! The <em class="foreign">Yesaul</em> <span class="translator-note">[a Cossack leader]</span> will be pleased that our numbers are growing.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wounded&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, we&rsquo;ll heal you up.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m young&mdash; I was born in &rsquo;24.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, we&rsquo;ll take you anyway&hellip; We have guys your age! &hellip; So will you join us?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>He opened the door and kneed me into the cell. I flew into a dark, cold, cell where, on the floor next to me a guy was dying. He was a teacher. He was listening to the radio and writing down dispatches from the Soviet Information Bureau <span class="author-note">[for leaflets]</span>, on the back of school notebooks. He forgot that the back of the sheets had a school stamp on it&mdash;&ldquo;For exams only.&rdquo; When they found out that the paper came from the school, suspicion fell on him. They beat him terribly for those leaflets.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where they kept us. There were others, too, who were braver than I was. They&rsquo;d bang on the door and yell,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Bastard! Open up! Give us water!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>And he would shout back,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Should have surrendered! Then we&rsquo;d feed you! Since you didn&rsquo;t, have your Stalin feed you!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>And in a week, they herded us toward Rostov, with our hands on our head! Those same kilometers back from Aksay to Rostov! They brought us to a P.O.W. camp, where we had to walk through a narrow passage, brushing away the feet of hung corpses with our heads. That&rsquo;s how they made the entrance, so that you&rsquo;d have to do that with your head. They&rsquo;d already turned blue, the corpses. They were hanging&hellip; The corpses had wooden tags hung on them: &ldquo;Yids,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Commissars.&rdquo; No questions asked&hellip;</p>
<p>And so we came to the camp.</p>
<p>In the camp there were some 20 prisoners and some multi-level bunk beds. Officers were playing cards, gambling with their decorations and belts. They weren&rsquo;t giving anyone any food. People would chew belts, pick the pockets of anyone who had anything. In a week they lined us up and drove us <span class="author-note">[further]</span>&mdash;a group of about a thousand people. Germans with machine guns stood at the front and back, either by themselves or in pairs, I don&rsquo;t remember how many. The crowd had a thousand prisoners, and we were flanked on the right and left by Armenians and Georgians, volunteer enforcers who were serving the Germans. That&rsquo;s how they led us.</p>
<p>If someone fell behind, a German would let go of one of the dogs&rsquo; leashes and shout, &ldquo;<em class="foreign">Faß!</em>&rdquo; The dog would jump on the weak man&rsquo;s back, topple him, stand on his chest with its front paws and bite through his throat. Blood would flow, the dog would lick itself and run back to its handler. And everyone would keep going. Then two or three prisoners from the column would be taken to toss the corpse into the ditch. They&rsquo;d toss it, and the column&hellip;</p>
 
<p>We got to Ilovaisk, and about 300 of us had already been shot, ripped apart, or killed. The column was small <span class="author-note">[now]</span>. They did, however, give us a cup of seeds and a cup of corn. We ate it instantly&mdash;we were hungry. We ate the seeds without shelling them just to fill our stomachs with something. Along the way I&rsquo;d also spent the night in the village of Chaltyr. It was a large, rich Armenian village. They had some people spend the night in the pigpens, others spent the night in the sheepfold, and I was put in the stables. Not just me, but another 200 people. During the day, the sun warmed the snow, and it melted. Little streams were already flowing through the stables. These streams had horse manure in them. The horses staying there were the Germans&rsquo;, and they would feed them oats, so the streams had oats that the horses hadn&rsquo;t finished digesting. We fished those oats out of the streams, out of the horse manure, and ate it. That&rsquo;s how we fed ourselves, and we made it to Ilovaisk.</p>

<p>In Ilovaisk they put us in this two-story home. In the morning, they gathered the residents of Ilovaisk in the town square and told them, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re running a column of captured prisoners. Bring out what you have to feed them, because the Germans have no food to feed captured Russians.&rdquo; They put a regular gas drum in the square, and people threw in what they brought. Some brought cigarettes&mdash;into the pot. Some brought cereals&mdash;into the pot. Bread&mdash;into the pot; Corn&mdash;into the pot. Beets&mdash;everything that the people brought went into the pot.</p>

<p>A German stood next to the pot with a big stick that had a tin can tied to one end, and gave everyone a portion. Everyone was desperately rushing to try to get their portion of food first. Some took it in their caps, some in their coats, some had small pots, even though we didn&rsquo;t really have them. I got mine in some kind of rag, and I couldn&rsquo;t even eat it, because on the previous night I&rsquo;d already started to have diarrhea&mdash;probably from the oats in the horse manure. It was bloody. I couldn&rsquo;t eat anything. And so I went off to the side. The others were still fighting by the barrel to get their portion, and maybe even seconds.</p>
 
<p>A woman came up to me&mdash;she was on the sidewalk, and we were all in the road&mdash;and said,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Son&hellip; some boys are &rsquo;bout to come here with a sleigh they use to deliver coal to the German officers&rsquo; homes. The sleigh has a big box. Get in it, and they&rsquo;ll take you away.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d made friends with another soldier while we walked. We helped one another carry on, since we were both weak. When we spent the night in Ilovaisk, I gave him my sweater and said, &ldquo;Trade this for bread, because they&rsquo;ll shoot me here. I can&rsquo;t go on, and I have blood in my stool. I can&rsquo;t walk anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone who refused to go on was brought to the mine, shot, and shoved down the mine shaft. Anyone who wasn&rsquo;t killed by the bullet died in the mine. When Lucy and I visited Ilovaisk in 1973, we went with this woman&mdash;Nastya, the one who told me to go with those boys&mdash;she took us to the mine and showed us the shaft. The mine is still inactive, and there&rsquo;s a monument there to the fallen P.O.W.s.</p>

<p> I didn&rsquo;t go with those boys, but my friend&mdash;Vanya, from Kursk&mdash;did. He went with them and got in the box. They covered him with the tarp, told the German guard that they were delivering coal to the officers, and he let them go. And now I had nowhere to go.</p>
<p>She says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be shy&hellip; See that fence behind my back? There&rsquo;s a gate there. Go through it, make your way through the garden, and hide in the barn. I&rsquo;ll come for you in the evening.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>She stepped away and the crowd parted; I ran over to the fence.</p>
<p> I made it to the middle of the garden; suddenly, I hear the door of the house open and run into the outhouse to hide. A German officer comes out of the house and heads right for the outhouse, right for me. I had nothing left; he would have shot me on the spot. I looked awful, with that bag on my shoulders, tattered and wasted. I say &ldquo;Kh-kh-kh&rdquo;&mdash;I cough. And he turns, goes off to pee behind the house, and goes back inside the house. I hopped out of the outhouse, crossed the rest of the garden and climbed, or rather pulled myself up with frozen hands over a brick divider and made it into the barn.</p>

<p>After it got dark, I heard the door open, and a woman walked in. She said, &ldquo;Well, where are you? Come out, I&rsquo;ll take you home&hellip;&rdquo; And she took me home. The neighbors didn&rsquo;t even see us walking over to her house. It was a one-story house with apartments, like a barracks. She took me inside the house, where she had a husband and four children.</p>
<p>She says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I couldn&rsquo;t come sooner. I was boiling water. You&rsquo;re covered in lice.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>The lice had covered my whole body. I even had them in my eyebrows, and here <span class="author-note">[in the ears]</span>, and in my nose.</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Let me wash you.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I got undressed, and she brought all my clothes out into the cold and gave me a warm fur coat. She washed me: I sat in a tub, and she washed me with very hot water. I was short, and basically still just a boy&mdash;no soldier! A boy! And I changed into her husband&rsquo;s clothes, and she covered me with the coat.</p>
<p>At night, Germans who&rsquo;d come to this station and needed a place to spend the night knocked on the door. They sent me down to the cellar and put me in a barrel. And she said that the Germans couldn&rsquo;t stay here because there were many <em class="foreign">Kinder</em> here. She shouted to the soldier, &ldquo;<em class="foreign">Kinder, Kinder! Ja, ja, ja!</em> They&rsquo;ll cry, it&rsquo;ll be bad. <em class="foreign">schlecht, sclecht, Kinder</em>&hellip; So the soldiers moved on, and I slept. I woke up in the morning in a start. It felt like I&rsquo;d only slept for an instant: I&rsquo;d closed my eyes, and then I immediately woke up.</p>
 
<p>The bath, capture, the lice&hellip; Efim gave me my first ever shave, and when he was shaving me&mdash;Efim was his name, Efim Semyonovich Rogozhin, and she was Anastasiya Dimitrievna Rogozhina&mdash;when he was shaving me, he said,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Mykola!&rdquo;&mdash;That was me, Nikolay. <span class="author-notes">[He said my name in Ukrainian.]</span> &ldquo;Mykola! How come your hair grow like a Jew&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;What do you mean like a Jew&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Well you have <em class="foreign">payis</em> <span class="translator-note">[locks of hair commonly worn by Jews]</span> here, and here.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I&rsquo;d never shaved before.</p>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Who you come from?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Russian. From Chkalovsk, near Orenburg&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, he shaved me, and fed me some hominy, and I went to bed.</p>
 
<p>The next morning, I woke up and thought to myself, &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t stay in this hut. I&rsquo;m putting everyone at risk, not only these kind people who helped me to freedom, but also their four kids. They have four kids! If they find me, they&rsquo;ll kill the kids and execute everyone else. I have to leave.</p>

<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Nastya! Gather my things. I&rsquo;m going to cross the front lines because I can&rsquo;t stay here. I have no documents.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>She gathers my things and says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;You know, many prisoners are planning to escape tonight. One of them is staying with our neighbors. You can escape with him. Efim will drop you off outside the village, and you&rsquo;ll walk toward the front.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
 
<p>And he and I set out. We got the first hut, walked some 5 km. He pulled out a map of the Soviet Union that was <span class="author-note">[torn]</span> out of some geography textbook. It didn&rsquo;t even have Ukraine marked on it, much less our road. He says to the woman at the hut,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the fastest way to get to Voroshilovograd? Or Kramatorsk? There should be battles there; we have to get there.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as she saw the map, she yelled,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Oy, you must be partisans! Get out of this house! We&rsquo;ll be shot! Get out of here! You have no documents, so go to the Elder.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>We left. He decided to take the roads, and I decided to walk along the fields.</p>
<p>I follow the fields to a village where two girls were living, two orphans. Along the way I stopped at a hut&mdash;it was the village of Kuteinikovo. I came up to the hut and said,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;May I have some food?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>He brings out a piece of bread and says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Why are you walking here?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an orphan from Stalingrad, my parents died in the bombing. I&rsquo;m left to wander around, earning what I can.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>He says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Why keep earning like this?&mdash;You should marry a rich girl and move in with her family. There are two girls in this village. Marry one of them, and you&rsquo;re set. You won&rsquo;t go hungry, and you&rsquo;ll have a home. They live over there.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I went to that house. Turns out, I wouldn&rsquo;t have suited them as a husband&mdash;they were too old for me. And besides, how could I do that?! I have a mission: to cross the front line. I already decided for myself. I can&rsquo;t stay.</p>
<p>When I fell asleep at night, the <em class="foreign">Polizei</em> came&hellip; They were looking for someone who&rsquo;d killed a policeman. Before the <em class="foreign">Polizei</em> came, they quickly sent me up to the attic on a ladder, and put down a bottle of moonshine and a cinder bucket in the room&mdash;since they heat their homes with coal there, in the Donets Basin.</p>
<p>The cops walked in and said,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Hello, girls! Anyone else here?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>They say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;No one.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>They say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Half a liter.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Well, since there&rsquo;s no one else, then we&rsquo;ll arrest the half liter&hellip;&rdquo; And they left.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I came down to them from the attic.</p>
 
<p>In the morning, they told me,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Mykola! You can&rsquo;t leave. The village is surrounded by police and Don Cossacks. Because last night someone killed a policeman. Maybe the police themselves killed their fellow officer, so that, when the Russians come, they can say they were partisans, or maybe the partisans really did do it, we don&rsquo;t know. But you can&rsquo;t leave the village.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t really stay. I have to leave. How long can I be here?&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait out today, see where the posts are and how they&rsquo;re being watched, and you can leave tomorrow&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>So the next day, I set out, but not in the direction of the front, but in the opposite direction, as if I were moving away from the front, so that I could get outside the village fence.</p>
<p>Some cossack on a horse caught up to me.</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Who are you?!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nobody.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Do you have documents?&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;re going back to Kuteinikovo, to the village.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>So I came back.</p>
<p>They locked us in a barn&mdash;there were a few people in there like me, it turned out. No documents. P.O.W.s. They gathered us together, and marched us to Ilovaisk during the day.</p>
<p>They herded us into the same house that I was at the first time. But this time I knew the exits, and let myself out through the barbed wire. I came back to Nastya, and said,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Nastya! I can&rsquo;t go anywhere without documents. I&rsquo;ve got to cross over the front line!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>She says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Oy, it&rsquo;s so good that Mykola came back! Here&rsquo;s the plan. I will go to my friend, my kids&rsquo; godmother. She&rsquo;s a secretary with the police. I told her about a dream I had the other night. She said, &lsquo;That means some surprise guest will come to see you.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll go and tell her that you are that guest, my cousin from Stalingrad.</li>
</ul>
<p>So she went and told her friend. Her friend said,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Well, alright. Let him come. We will make him a temporary <em class="foreign">Ausweis</em>&mdash;identification.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>So the neighbor and Nastya went to the police, and said that they remembered, how, as a young boy, I used to come to visit Nastya from Stalingrad, that I was her cousin. And they issued me an <em class="foreign">Ausweis</em> that said, &ldquo;Korneyev, Nikolay Ivanovich, born 1924.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to finish the paperwork, they had to fill out this one column: &ldquo;Distinguishing marks on the subject&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; The <em class="foreign">Polizei</em> orders,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Undress!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>But the clerk was a young girl, so Nastya says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;undress?&rsquo; She&rsquo;s a girl, he&rsquo;s a boy; she&rsquo;d be embarrassed. Jut write that he has a birthmark on his upper lip!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>So they wrote down for my distinguishing features, a birthmark on the upper lip. Blue eyes. I couldn&rsquo;t possibly undress for them&hellip; <span class="translator-note">[For the Germans, circumcision was proof of Jewishness.]</span> So they wrote down all this information and brought me to the head of the police. When I came to the head of police&rsquo;s office, I started blowing snot out of my nose, like so, so that I&rsquo;d get it to hang, and started to pick my nose. He looked at me and shouted right away, <em class="foreign">O russische Schwein! Geh!</em> and kicked me out of his office. And Nastya got the document that said that I really was &hellip;</p>
<p>I get the document and go to the clerk, and she gives me papers to sign, saying I received the document. And I have to sign as Korneyev. I start writing, &ldquo;V-o&rdquo; <span class="translator-note">In Russian, &ldquo;Wolfson&rdquo; is spelled like &ldquo;Vol&rsquo;fson&rdquo;]</span>&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not a Wolfson anymore! I write my signature mechanically. I write those two letters and freeze.</p>
<p>And now I can&rsquo;t remember my &ldquo;last name&rdquo;. Would you believe that!</p>
She says,
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo; Well why did you stop? Write! Your last name goes here! Why did you write &lsquo;Vo&rsquo;?!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sorry, I wanted to write  &lsquo;Vo&hellip;ksal&rsquo;naya street&rdquo;&hellip;the street I live on&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;No, you have to write your last name&mdash;Korneyev.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>And I crossed out &ldquo;Vo,&rdquo; and wrote &ldquo;Ko&hellip;r&hellip;ne&hellip;yev&rdquo;. And with these documents, I came home&hellip;</p>
 
<p>And in the morning, my temperature was high. I was sick. My lungs were infected. Nastya took me to the church&hellip;</p>
<p>How do we treat this? What do we do?</p>
<p>There, the sexton who was in charge and handed out candles, said,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to do here but drink a glass of your own urine. It&rsquo;s malaria: his temperature is high.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>So I drank a glass of my own urine.</p>
<p>And on the next morning, my malaria disappeared. I had the shakes the whole time while it was leaving. I went in and out of sleep, in and out of delirium from the high temperature. I was calling out the names of my friends (from Gomel)&rsquo;. There was Stasik, whose name was Polish, and there were Jews: David, Isaac was there&hellip; And Efim says to me,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;How come you were always remembering those Jewish names in your ravings?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;We all lived around the same yard, in the city. All kinds of different folks lived there&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>(He never said &ldquo;Yids.&rdquo; He would later say, &ldquo;We came from Gulay-Polya. My parents helped Jews there hide from Nestor Makhno during the Civil war.) And then from that urine, I got boils all over. Again we went to the church.</p>
<p>The sexton said,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;You need to take sunflower-seed oil, reboil it with wax, and spread that around on your body&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I had boils all over my body from that urine. It was some kind of poisoning. And Nastya healed me again, and then she said,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Have you been baptized?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;I think so&hellip; We lived in the city. We never really got baptized&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no good, Mykola, you have to get baptized.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>And so she took me to the church&mdash;to get baptized. And it came my turn to be baptized. I could no longer fit inside the baptismal font.</p>
</dd>
 
<dt>Katya</dt>
<dd><p>There was a line?</p></dd>
<dt>Ben</dt>
<dd>
<p>Yeah, there were a lot of people&hellip; Under the Germans, everyone went to get baptized. Under Soviet rule, no one went to get baptized&hellip;</p>
 
<p>And the man sprinkled me with the water. And at that moment, German planes <span class="author-note">[flew overhead]</span>. And we all went down to the cellar, where all of the church&rsquo;s supplies were held, and where, for two hours, while the bombing was going on, the priest told Jew jokes&mdash;and everyone laughed. It was very merry. After that, we went home. Nastya said,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll pray like we&rsquo;re supposed to, and all your illnesses will go away. Here&rsquo;s a prayer; read it: Psalm 90, <span class="translator-note">[Orthodox Psalm 90 is Psalm 91 in the West]</span> &lsquo;He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty&hellip;&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
 
<p>And I read that prayer and my illness passed. But I was still very thin and sickly. And the German, the head of the station where I worked as a janitor, said that Korneyev should be put on guard duty to defend the watermelon patch or he&rsquo;ll wither away on us. And I got rations, and brought them home, and didn&rsquo;t eat them, because every week I was bringing home half a liter of vegetable oil and a loaf of bread made of wet oat meal. But we had four kids! Somehow we had to feed everyone!</p>
 
<p>At home, Efim made a smithy, and I forged metal there with him. I was a hammerer, and then I made hooks of all kinds, and I could make hoes, too, and chopping knives, and rakes. Nastya would sell what we made. And then I was sometimes able to steal salt from the train station. I&rsquo;d bring home some salt in a bag, and then Nastya would sell it at the market that day&mdash;it brought at least some money. We might get a piece of meat or a cup of milk, or half a bag of corn. We&rsquo;d boil the corn and make soups with the beets. That&rsquo;s how we lived&hellip;</p>
 
<p>Fall came. And I couldn&rsquo;t stay there any longer. Since I&rsquo;d been there, February, March, April, May, June, July, and even August had passed. Our forces had already begun to advance. Now, when we&rsquo;re advancing, it&rsquo;s the perfect time to run. So I ran. And I crossed the front line. It wasn&rsquo;t far from Ilovaisk.</p>

<p>The first people I saw were our own scouts. Their commander says&mdash;the soldiers say, &ldquo;we detained him trying to cross the front line.&rdquo; The commander says, &ldquo;How did he cross the front line? This plot is mined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t know that it was mined. How I made it across, I don&rsquo;t even know myself. But I made it across&hellip;</p>
<p>He calls me over and asks, &ldquo;Full name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Wolfson, Beniamin Borisovich. I was in a machine gun company in the 49th division.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>He says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the one we have that &ldquo;missing in action&rdquo; dispatch about.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Yeah, probably.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Then stay and fight with us.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>But the <abbr title="SMERt' SHpiyonam">SMERSH</abbr> commander&mdash;<abbr title="SMERt' SHpiyonam">SMERSH</abbr> is like the army&rsquo;s <abbr title="Narodnyy Komissariat Vnutrennikh Del">NKVD</abbr> <span class="translator-note">[a precursor of the KGB]</span>&mdash;said that no, he should be arrested and put in the stockade for further investigation into who he is. So they arrested me and threw me in the stockade. And I sat there for a month! They interrogated me every day. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a German spy! Admit it!&rdquo; Every night, Major Kogan would fire bullets into the wall above my head.</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Tell us, you cur, where you finished German spy school&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;What school could I have gone to?! They&rsquo;re Nazis! I&rsquo;m a Jew!&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d recruit &lsquo;Jews&rsquo; too&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m circumcised!&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;They could have circumcised you&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>And so it went every night&hellip;</p>
</dd>
 
<dt>Katya</dt>
<dd><p>I don&rsquo;t understand; why would they arrest you?</p></dd>
<dt>Ben</dt>
<dd>
<p>How else? I was a P.O.W. They have to arrest me, because maybe you&rsquo;re a traitor, maybe you&rsquo;re a villain, maybe you&rsquo;re a spy. They need to know who you are, if you came back from being captured.</p>
<p>They probed me a long time. Every night, at two or three in the morning, they&rsquo;d wake me up and make me write down how and where I got captured. Everything in great detail. And then they&rsquo;d compare, which version I wrote the most in. Well, to make a long story short, a month of these interrogations went by. One time, they even brought in some cabby who drove a cab in Gomel&rsquo; before the war (in order to identify me). They said, &ldquo;Look, if you&rsquo;re from Gomel&rsquo;, he&rsquo;ll ask you if you really know Gomel&rsquo; and aren&rsquo;t a German spy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t possibly be a German spy, I&rsquo;m a Jew, how could I serve Hitler? Are you crazy?!</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Well now we&rsquo;ll find out&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>He asks me,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Do you know Aptechnaya Street?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Yeah, I know it. I lived there. It was called Aptechnaya before the Revolution, and then became Zharkovsky Street.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;And do you know a woman named Rybnikov?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Of course, I do, she was our neighbor.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;What!? You know Madam Rybnikov? But she&rsquo;s a <span class="author-note">[former]</span> countess. I served as their driver before the Revolution. I drove her around in her carriage. Where&rsquo;s her son Gustav?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Her son&rsquo;s in Moscow. He&rsquo;s working for the Metro Construction Department. Her daughter Zinochka is also in Moscow.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, the investigator saw that I wasn&rsquo;t lying to him, that what I was saying was true. And in a month, I was allowed in the marching company. All the other former P.O.W.s got sent to the penal unit&mdash;straight into battle. Unlike them, I had an alibi&mdash;I was captured. And I didn&rsquo;t go home. Some would get captured near Moscow, but then escape and go home to the Don Basin. You understand? They didn&rsquo;t want to fight anymore. I didn&rsquo;t go back home. I didn&rsquo;t get married. Some guys got captured&mdash;and then got married&hellip; &ldquo;Ah,&hellip;you wanted to stay there already&hellip;&rdquo; You see, right? And I never served the Germans. I was never in the German army. So all the evidence was in support of letting me go to the front.</p>

<p>So I was sent to the front. And I landed in the Motorized Corps. We crossed the Don Basin, and Melitopol&rsquo;, fighting battles along the way. We made it to Crimea, to Sevastopol&rsquo;, and had battles there. Near Sevastopol&rsquo;, I was wounded. A piece of shrapnel hit me here <span class="author-note">[points to his left forearm]</span>. And so I landed in the Simferopol&rsquo; hospital. Spent about two weeks there. My war buddy Fyed&rsquo;ka <span class="author-note">[Sporynin]</span>, runs over to me and says,</p>

<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting sent to another part of the front. Don&rsquo;t lie around here in the hospital, come to the train station, and leave with us <span class="author-note">[with your unit]</span>&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>So I ran out of the hospital, in my slippers and gown, just as I was. The orderly is running down the street chasing after me, and she says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;But you wanted a release! You need the release, that you&rsquo;re leaving voluntarily. Just give me back the gown and slippers! They keep track of that stuff!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I ran to the train station, gave back the gown and slippers and got a uniform. They brought us to Dorogobuzh, near Smolensk. And there we stepped into battle again. I was still wounded. My arm was still wrapped in a plaster splint. I couldn&rsquo;t hold anything in my arms, but I made it to the front.</p>
<p>There was a huge battle on the Dubis river, near Shavli <span class="author-note">[Shaulai]</span>, I fought wounded, even though I could have been lying in a hospital&hellip; Well for that, I have two citations of merit from Stalin. Commander-in-Chief Stalin thanked those who participated in those battles. I got a medal &ldquo;for valor,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Order of the Red Star&rdquo;</p>
 
<p>And then through Lithuania, we made it to Prussia. I became a scout for the 15th Sevastopol&rsquo; Regiment. I would go on scouting missions. It was a lot easier. In my last battle, the three of us took 30 Germans prisoner. Mass surrenders were already happening. This was at dawn. They were all sleeping in some kind of barn. One of us ran around the barn and fired his machine gun into the air to make them think that  they were surrounded. And the two of us burst in from either side and started shooting at the ceiling. I shout at them in German, &ldquo; Come out, one at a time, unarmed.&rdquo; The whole platoon surrendered. It was 1944. They didn&rsquo;t want to fight anymore After the war, in 1956, I was awarded the &ldquo;Second Order of the Great Patriotic War,&rdquo; for that mission. We slept all day, to go out on missions at night.</p>

<p>In the same battle near Könnigsberg where, they say, Marshall Chernyakhovskiy was killed, I was wounded. Some kind of shell hit, glass was broken, and everyone was wounded. I was wounded too. The piece of shrapnel went in here <span class="author-note">[points to the lower-right corner of his mouth]</span>. I was pulled back from the front line. I see a military nurse coming at me and try to show her, &ldquo; Bandage me, do you see?&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve got blood flowing here&hellip; It came in here, and here is where it came out <span class="author-note">[left front part of the neck]</span> Everything here was covered in blood. I spit on the snow and saw my lower jaw. We had white ghillie suits on, and mine was covered in blood.</p>

<p>She says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t give you bandages, because I&rsquo;m waiting for the offensive. I need this for my own men! You&rsquo;re not from our unit.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Fyedya met me, picked me up&mdash;my friend&mdash;and hauled me to the field hospital. All my teeth were rattling, because I no longer had any teeth below. And they put me on a stretcher and sent me to the operating room. (The surgeon later told me that a piece of shrapnel had come within two millimeters of cutting my carotid artery.) From the operating room, they sent me to Kaunas. From Kaunas, to Leningrad. I stayed in Leningrad for a while, and then they sent me, and a whole echelon of other wounded soldiers&mdash;after surgery&mdash;everything was sewn up, and I have a piece of rubber hanging from my jaw&mdash;to Sverdlovsk, where they put me in a big specialized hospital for jaw and face injuries. And they tell me that&hellip;</p>
</dd>

<dt>Katya</dt>
<dd><p>To Sverdlovsk? But that&rsquo;s far!</p></dd>

<dt>Ben</dt>
<dd>
<p>That&rsquo;s because it was a special hospital for face and jaw injuries. Arms and legs could be healed anywhere, but not special jaw surgeries. Because it was a very complicated injury. My tongue was cut. There were pieces of shrapnel everywhere. My mouth couldn&rsquo;t open or close. It was scary. That&rsquo;s how I came to Sverdlovsk.</p>

<p>(The hospital was located on 7 LaSalle St., and next to it, on 5 LaSalle St. was a medical student dorm.) The guys ask me,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
<li>&ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;From Gomel&rsquo;.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;You know, there are a lot of nursing students here. Some are from Gomel&rsquo;. Stop by their dorm in the evening.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>So I sneak through a hole <span class="author-note">[in the fence]</span>, For two cigarettes&mdash;we got cigarettes; everyone got snuff, but we got cigarettes. We couldn&rsquo;t smoke them (because of our injuries)&mdash;basically, I traded those cigarettes for socks, a field cap, and a soldier&rsquo;s blouse, and in my long-johns, covered by my gown, I went to the dorm to investigate.</p>

<ul class="dialogue">
<li>&ldquo;Who here was evacuated from Gomel&rsquo;?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>They tell me,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Lucy Katzman here from Gomel&rsquo;&mdash;she&rsquo;s on the second floor.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Tell her to come down, that someone from Gomel&rsquo; wants to see her.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Lucy, my future wife, came down. She did not recognize me.</p>
<p>I tell her,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Lucy! Don&rsquo;t you recognize me?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>And I smiled. Only then did she recognize me. Everything else was all bandaged up <span class="author-note">[the whole face, except for the eyes]</span>. She recognized me only from my eyes&hellip;</p>
<p>And we spent two weeks together and I was discharged, told to finish recuperating at home </p>

<p>I went to Gomel&rsquo;. It had already been freed. It was 1945, probably May. I found out about the Victory while I was in the hospital. We all wept when we found out that Victory was declared. They took Berlin on May 2, and it was already clear we were going to win. Everyone cried because the war was over, and <span class="author-note">[even though we were]</span> all alive, well, some had been left alive and stayed whole, but we were all lying in the hospital as invalids. We couldn&rsquo;t eat, couldn&rsquo;t drink normally. Try to take anything in your mouth, it falls out. Some of us didn&rsquo;t have noses or jaws. Some completely lost the entire lower half of their face. Instead of a jaw, they had a rubber sack that collected their saliva. It was a terrifying hospital.</p>
 
<p>And I said to her <span class="author-note">[Lucy]</span>,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Want to be my wife?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>She said,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Are you kidding? How would that work?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I left. She read me her journal, where she&rsquo;d written about how she was in love with me during school, when she and I went to the same school. We were in the same drama club, and while I was making out with her girlfriends, she was pining over me. She really pined for me&hellip;</p>
<p>So I went to Gomel&rsquo; and told my mom,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Mom, I have a fiancée; I&rsquo;m getting married!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>But Lucy didn&rsquo;t know I was introducing her as my fiancée.</p>
 
<p>And I enrolled in the Injured Veterans&rsquo; Cooperative. Started to work there (as a photographer). I finished tenth grade in night school. Because I&rsquo;d only had nine grades of schooling. I was not a great student.</p>
 
<p>But I remembered that I&rsquo;d been promised admission into the theatrical university. So I went to Leningrad to enroll in the university, the Leningrad Theatrical Institute, although it was just out of audacity&mdash;I had no other basis. We traveled there in a happy group on the train. (All veterans who&rsquo;d just finished the 10th grade, who all wanted to go to the best institutes and universities&mdash;veterans were accepted without preliminary examinations.) As always, for the road, we were given&mdash;it was fall, August&mdash;tomatoes and cucumbers. I took out my dentures so that the seeds wouldn&rsquo;t get stuck in them &hellip; and accidentally threw the dentures out the window with the rest of the trash.</p>
<p>So I came to Leningrad to apply to the theater arts institute&mdash;without my dentures&hellip; From the first station I could, I sent a telegram home: &ldquo;<tt class="telegram">URGENT SEND REPLACEMENT DENTURES LENINGRAD</tt>.&rdquo; Even though I knew that the exam was soon, and that the dentures wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make it in time. When I got to Leningrad I sent another urgent telegram to Gomel&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And my brother&rsquo;s mother-in-law&mdash;my brother was living in Leningrad, studying at the University, and I was living with him&mdash;she was a school principal&mdash;she said,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;I have a student whose father makes dentures. He can make you a new set quickly.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>And in 24 hours, (for a hefty sum) he made me dentures. (And I spent the whole night before the exam learning to read the alphabet: Ah, Be, Ve, Ge,&hellip; and again, until morning came.) And I went to take the exam at the theater institute. I read prose, songs, fables, poems, I did training exercises, sang&mdash;and it was all wonderful&hellip; I was accepted and enrolled.</p>

<p>And on my first day of speech class, Professor Chaika tells me</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Young man, how come your nasals and your fricatives are blending together? Please open your mouth. I want to see your apparatus&mdash;what you speak with.&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>I opened my mouth.</p>
<p>She says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;My God, you have dentures!!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I say,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Then you cannot study here&hellip; Either transfer to the Directing department, or drop out. I can&rsquo;t teach a person with dentures. Today it&rsquo;ll be one kind of dentures, tomorrow, some other kind. What kind of diction will you have?&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>But in that time I&rsquo;d already learned how to speak. I really did have good diction. Only a specialist could detect the effect of the dentures, but a mere mortal wouldn&rsquo;t know that I had them. I had some diction training before the war, because before the war, I mostly spoke Belorussian, with a mixture of Polish and Jewish words thrown in there, my speech had very little Russian in it. No one really knew it. They knew some, but not a lot&hellip; I only heard real Russian when my director spoke it. He spent so much time with me, taught me the right pronunciations for things, which is very important. So by the time the war came, I already spoke pretty clean Russian, knew Belorussian and Ukranian. Well, to make a long story short, I dropped out of the theatrical institute. I felt terrible. I stepped out onto the embankment of the Neva and just wanted to jump in. I come home, and Maria Israelevna, my brother&rsquo;s mother-in-law says, &ldquo;Benya, don&rsquo;t worry. They&rsquo;ll take you anywhere, you&rsquo;re a veteran, just go to any university.&rdquo; And so I enrolled in the Political Economics department at <abbr title="Leningradskij Gossudarstvinnyj Universitet">LGU</abbr> <span class="translator-note">[Leningrad State University]</span>.</p>

<p>I continued to act on my own, as an amateur. I joined the Leningrad University theater club&hellip; I worked in the Pushkin Theater and the Aleksandrinsky Theater as an understudy, I was an extra in movies. Igor&rsquo; Gorbachov studied with me&mdash;he&rsquo;s now the artistic director of the Pushkin Academic theater in Leningrad. We were in a production of <em>The Government Inspector</em> together, a student production that brought Igor fame. In that show, I played Zemlianika.</p>

<p>And besides that, I worked as a Young Pioneer leader, I unloaded train cars&mdash;I would do anything to earn enough to get by, to survive this trial&hellip;</p>
<p>It took a year for them to stop rationing bread, and they started to sell it freely. With my own money, still wearing my greatcoat and soldier&rsquo;s boots, I&rsquo;d buy groceries and send them to my mom, dad, and sister&mdash;to Gomel&rsquo;, so that they could somehow get by, because it was even more difficult down there.</p>

<p>And so I graduated from Leningrad University. I graduated from the Political Economics department. And during my final review, they realized I had been a prisoner of war. So I couldn&rsquo;t work in regional centers; I had to be outside of their borders. And they wouldn&rsquo;t give me any teaching jobs. So when I got offers from Petrozavodsk, Chita, and Odessa, I was forbidden from taking them.</p>

<p>Instead they told me, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not political economics, but there&rsquo;s a position for a regular economist&mdash;an accountant&mdash;in Smolensk. Will you take it?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it. I&rsquo;ll go wherever. Why would I sit around here without work?&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>So I went to Smolensk.</p>

<p>Lucy called me there and asked, &ldquo;How have you set yourself up there?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Come down and you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; She came down.</p>

<p>I got a room. Bare walls. A table made from wooden planks nailed to the wall. No furniture. I had a backpack of books and another bag with bedding and my greatcoat. That&rsquo;s it. I took the door off the pantry, put it on four bricks&mdash;that was my bed. I turned a crate into a chair. That&rsquo;s the kind of prison-like situation it was. But at least we had a place. Starting to make a life, so to speak.</p>

<p>I say, &ldquo;So, do you like it here?&rdquo; She says,</p>
<ul class="dialogue">
    <li>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not bad. I like it well enough.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Well since you like it, then let&rsquo;s get married, you can move here from Tagil&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>At that time she lived in Lower Tagil, she&rsquo;d already finished her medical training and was working there as a health inspector&hellip;</p>

<p>Lucy came and we went to get legally married. After coming back from the registrar, we split a piece of candy. That was all we had. We cancelled the wedding festivities.</p>

<p>But Mama sent me a letter, &ldquo;Come down on November 7<sup>th</sup>, we will have a wedding for you in Gomel&rsquo;.&rdquo; We bought tickets and went to Gomel&rsquo;. We were supposed to change trains once&mdash;at Bryansk. But they wouldn&rsquo;t give us tickets. So then I just wrote in permanent marker on the ticket, and wet it with my saliva. I wrote, &ldquo;Car: such-and-such, Seat: such-and-such&hellip;&rdquo; They let us in the car. It turned out to be a military car, not a civillian one! We almost got kicked out. I say to the conductor, &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got a wedding to go to! How could you kick us off?&hellip;&rdquo; And so we made it to Gomel&rsquo; Some thirty guests had gathered at our place.</p>

<p>They bought&mdash;well, everything you could buy for a wedding. They threw us a wedding.</p>

<p>My mom was a pious woman, a believer, who went to synagogue. Dad didn&rsquo;t really celebrate that. He was an atheist, he didn&rsquo;t really believe in God&hellip;</p>
</dd>
<dt>Katya</dt>
<dd><p>And your mom had started to believe in God already?</p></dd>
<dt>Ben</dt>
<dd>
<p>Yes. She came back to Gomel&rsquo; after the war. There was no synagogue, about twenty Jews. They pooled their money and paid some guy, who would let them have a large room, and in the large room they would pray. And Mama went there to pray.</p>
<p>Mama said, &ldquo;The wedding ceremony must be according to Jewish custom. There must be a <em class="foreign">chuppa</em>.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s this canopy you have to stand under. And where are you going to get a Rabbi? There&rsquo;s no one&hellip; So then my mom&rsquo;s uncle came, who had served ten years in prison for being a believer. He had some kind of higher Jewish theological education. But that kind of thing was being prosecuted. And so he worked as a dental technician. In 1936, when Stalin&rsquo;s constitution was being adopted, he got ten years, and came out in 1947. And in 1951, Lucy and I had our wedding. We stood under that <em class="foreign">chuppa</em>. They made me learn how to say in Hebrew, &ldquo;&hellip;now you are consecrated to me as my wife according to the laws of Moses and Israel.&rdquo; I put a ring on her finger and we became husband and wife. Now according to custom&hellip;</p>

<p>And we returned to Smolensk again.</p>

<p>I got asthma. Terrible asthma. Slava was born. After coming home from the hospital, Lucy&rsquo;s old tuberculosis came back. She couldn&rsquo;t breast feed, they&rsquo;d covered her breast with a towel. I ran around the city, asked one woman for milk, helped her nurse. I would bring the milk home early in the morning. Lucy&rsquo;s mom and I would pasteurize it together, and I would go to work. They wouldn&rsquo;t let me work in the city of Smolensk itself; they sent me as the senior economist to the Krasnobor condenser. The station was &ldquo;Krasnyy Bor.&rdquo; The next station was Gnezdovo, and after that&mdash;Katyn&rsquo;. Where our boys in &rsquo;40 had massacred the Polish. That&rsquo;s where I worked. Do you understand? And we went into that forest, full of young pines, and we saw the shell casings on the forest floor. But the casings were German&mdash;our boys had already added some &ldquo;material evidence&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>I worked at that condenser for a while, and, as a Group II Wounded Veteran, I got a permit to go to the Crimea. I could see that it was easier for me to breathe down there. We decided to move. Lucy qualified for disability&mdash;because of her tuberculosis, and I qualified because of my bronchial asthma, and my mother-in-law&mdash;because of her heart, and Slava had a hard time breathing, too. He was three years old. And I was thirty-three.</p>

<p>We moved to Alupka and found a place to live. And I continued to have trouble breathing&hellip;</p>
