    My career has spanned multiple fields and roles, unified by the common theme of developing
    technical solutions to challenging problems. I am at my best when I get to combine my technical
    depth in physical chemistry, computational biology, machine learning, and software development
    with thoughtful communication and creative, collaborative problem solving to grow ideas into
    successful projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm currently a Manager of Government Business at
    <a href="http://www.ginkgobioworks.com/"
       title="Ginkgo Bioworks">Ginkgo Bioworks</a>, where I develop partnerships with U. S. Government
    institutions to solve pressing challenges with synthetic biology and expand Ginkgo's
    bioengineering capabilities. Before moving to the Government Business Unit, I was on the
    Software team, where I helped build Ginkgo's internal software tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    Prior to Ginkgo, I worked at
    <a href="http://www.athenahealth.com/"
       title="athenahealth"><b>athena</b>health</a>, developing electronic
    health records software to help doctors provide better care for their
    patients.

    I received my Ph.D. in computational immunology from the
    <a href="http://web.mit.edu/chemistry/"
       title="MIT Department of Chemistry">Department of Chemistry</a> at
    <a href="http://web.mit.edu/"
       title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</a>,
    where I was a student and graduate researcher in the
    <a href="http://web.mit.edu/akcgroup/"
       title="Arup Chakraborty Research Group">research group of Arup Chakraborty</a>.
    In my research, I applied a diverse repertoire of theoretical tools from the
    physical sciences to study interesting problems in immunology. I have also
    taught discussion and review sessions for both undergraduate and graduate
    school physical chemistry courses.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before graduate school, I attended the
    <a href="http://www.wisc.edu/"
       title="University of Wisconsinâ€”Madison"
      >University of Wisconsin&mdash;Madison</a>,
    where I majored in chemistry and computer science while studying the
    biophysics of proteins and nucleic acids in the
    <a href="http://www.chem.wisc.edu/~cui/"
       title="Qiang Cui Research Group"
      >research group of Professor Qiang Cui</a>.
