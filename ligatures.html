<h2>About Ligatures</h2>
  <div class="datum">
  On July 17, 2005, I found that Unicode had symbols for 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(typography)"
  title="Wikipedia: Ligatures (typography)">ligatures</a>,
  which many common fonts implemented. These elegant remnants of the days of 
  quality typesetting are conspicously absent from almost every webpage I have
  seen. <span class="comp" title="Lamport TeX">LaTeX</span> and 
  <span class="comp">TeX</span> use them naturally, as do all other good typesetting
  and layout programs. Not only do they look better (compare the text below in
  various fonts for some examples), they also give the document a more professional
  feel.
  
  Since I found the Unicode entities, I have been going through
  the code of this site by hand (or <span title="Stream EDitor" class="comp">
  sed</span> script), changing appropriate letter combinations into ligatures.
  If you notice a mistake or an absent ligature, noting that each font 
  implements a different set, please let me know.
  If anyone would like to implement these features in their 
  <acronym title="HypterText Markup Language" >HTML</acronym> text formatting programs,
  I (and the rest of the font-loving nerds out there) would greatly appreciate
  it. I have found that all of the default fonts for modern operating systems
  (<span class="comp">Windows</span>, various &#64258;avors of 
  <span title="Pun of MULTICS" class="comp">UNIX</span>, including 
  <span class="comp"> MacOS X</span>) all implement at least the 
  &ldquo;&#xfb01;&rdquo; and &ldquo;&#xfb02;&rdquo; ligatures, so it is 
  possible to make a general implementation work.

<h2>Ligatures in Typesetters</h2>
  <div class="datum">In my continuing search for a way to effectively implement
  ligatures in webpages, my friend Evan pointed me to
  <a class="comp" href="http://www.michelf.com/projects/php-smartypants/">PHP
  SmartyPants</a>, <a href="http://www.michelf.com/">Michel Fortin</a>&rsquo;s 
  <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> port of 
  <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber</a>&rsquo;s
  <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/" class="comp" >
  SmartyPants</a>. This simple, yet incredibly effective 
  <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> script seemed
  like the perfect opportunity to implement my ligature plan. Indeed, in some 20
  minutes, with only minimal knowledge of 
  <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>, I was able to 
  modify the original version of 
  <a class="comp" href="http://www.michelf.com/projects/php-smartypants/">PHP
  SmartyPants</a> to also change the letters &ldquo;fi&rdquo; and &ldquo;fl&rdquo;
  into the corresponding ligatures. If you would like to use it, I&rsquo;m providing a
  copy here. Drop me a line if you do use it&mdash;I&rsquo;m interested to see who,
  if anyone, does.
  </div>
  <div class="datum">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="datum">The next day, I moved on to the original
  <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/" class="comp" >SmartyPants</a>.
  At this point, I had as little experience with <span class="comp">perl</span>
  as I did with <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>, but the
  code was easy to patch. After a bit of work, I had fully functional ligature
  replacement in the original plugin. Let me know if you use this script as
  well. <strike>I am awaiting emails from both maintaners as to what to do with
  the patch. I will post updates here if anything happens.</strike> Michel
  Fortin replied that he would implement the patch in <span class="comp">PHP
  Smartypants</span> if it was added to the original. John Gruber, however, refused 
  to add the patch, saying that it violated the separation between formatting 
  and data. I see his point, but I've decided to continue to post my patches here,
  because who knows? People might just use them, and not everyone cares about
  those distinctions.</div>

<h2 class="comp">Fancypants</h2>
  <div class="datum">
  On January 12, 2007, Peter Bex wrote to me, saying that my 
  <span class="comp">Smartypants</span> patch had inspired him to write 
  <a href=
	  "http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/eggs/3/fancypants.html"
	  ><span class="comp">Fancypants</span></a>,
  a markup manipulator like <span class="comp">Smartypants</span>, that 
  also includes ligature support and support for pretty arrows.
  Unlike <span class="comp">Smartypants</span>, however, 
  <span class="comp">Fancypants</span> uses Scheme and 
  <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/SXML.html">SXML</a>.
  This leads to a more natural, more extensible structure
  for the code.
